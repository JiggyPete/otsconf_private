We carefully selected our first seven speakers to show you in which direction we want the conference to go. There will be **ten more talks** for which we received more than 150 proposals. We will announce the final selection in January.

This is a web development conference, so expect talks about frontend and backend development, security, design, typography, accessibility, open source and our culture.
