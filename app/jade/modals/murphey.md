You've got the hang of this whole client-side application development thing. Old browsers, new browsers, mobile, desktop â€“ it's all just another day at the office for you. But now users are trying to type in your Very Important Form, and nothing is happening and you can't even reload the page; a user has reported an XSS attack that, according to your code, can't actually be happening; and, rarely but not never, your app just doesn't load at all.

Join me for a whirlwind telling of tales from the trenches of third-party JavaScript application development, where the only thing you control on a site is a single script tag, and where it's all but impossible to dream up every hostile environment in which your code will be expected to Just Work. Think you can trust the window.JSON, Array.prototype, or window.jQuery you found lying around? Think again. "It works on my machine" has never rung quite so hollow.
