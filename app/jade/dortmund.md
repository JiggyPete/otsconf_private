Dortmund, from an historical point of view has always been an important place in the whole Ruhr Area. It has been - and still is known for its coal mines and breweries.

Nowadays not just the city, but the whole local industry changed. With two universities close to the city center, Dortmund offers a lot of space for education and a growing startup community, especially in the field of information technology.

Therefore, it is home to an amazing [coworkingspace](http://www.heimatdesign.de/coworking/), a [hackerspace](http://www.chaostreff-dortmund.de/) and many other meetups like [Freifunk](http://wiki.freifunk.net/Dortmund).
