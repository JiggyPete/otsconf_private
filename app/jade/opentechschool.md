[OpenTechSchool](http://www.opentechschool.org/) came about in
Berlin in April 2012, inspired by the first locally run Rails Girls event.
[Rails Girls](http://railsgirls.com/) is a separate movement that focuses on introducing women to tech through workshops about Ruby on Rails.
The founders of OpenTechSchool wanted to do something similar, but open to all genders and experience levels.

There are chapters of OpenTechSchool in several countries spread across the world,
from Germany to Australia, from Kenya to America, and plenty more in between!
OTS brings together technology enthusiasts of all genders, backgrounds, and experience levels who want to coach or learn in a friendly environment.
The learning material is shared and collectively improved by the online community, and anyone is welcome to use it to organise new OTS chapters near them.

Further information about the local Dortmund chapter of OTS can be found [here](http://opentechschool.org/dortmund)
and on the [meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-dortmund/).
