It's the moment you’ve been dreading: the project of redesigning all consumer facing emails AND making them responsive becomes yours. And you've heard the rumors: designing emails means coding like it’s 1999, creating tables and adding styles inline (heaven forbid!), and throwing best practices and hopes of compatibility out the window. BREATHE. In this session, I’ll help you get your emails in shape for 2015 and ready for the responsive spotlight by showing you:

* Why you need a reusable, maintainable template (or three) and how to design one.
* When and how to use media queries and the ever controversial `!important`.
* How to make desktop, mobile, and web-based clients play nicely, and which ones to watch out for (sneaky devils).
* Third-party tools and knowledgeable blogs that weed through the ugliness and what parts you still need to code by hand.
