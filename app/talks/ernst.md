The development of evolutionary algorithms is heavily inspired by the processes that are involved in natural evolution.
 This talk is about the basics of evolutionary algorithms: What is an evolutionary
algorithm, what to do with it, when to apply it and what kind of problems are best to be solved by evolutionary algorithms.

The talk contains a lot of visual material with live demonstrations of concrete algorithm implementations.
