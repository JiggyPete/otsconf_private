Having majored in computer-engineering, Martin now works as a freelance JS- and web-developer in Hamburg/Germany.
Currently he spends a lot of his spare-time re-learning electrical engineering, working on
hardware-hacking projects and looking for ways to make the fields of web-development and hardware-hacking fit together.
