How many times did you have to get two different API’s to communicate with each
other and were left wondering what was the best way to get them talking? XML?
JSON? HTTP?

Sound familiar?

You have used service oriented architecture but your projects turned out
“speaking different languages” and you’re now faced with the arduous task of
being the translator. Life’s too short and #yolo! Although you may have opted
for the most appropriate technology, the correct design pattern and the optimal
algorithms, if you don’t get your applications talking correctly they will be
as good as a plate of spaghetti.

In this presentation I’ll show you the secret many companies have been using
for years to be able scale and respond to requests faster. I’ll show you a demo
of a life-like application that consumes messages added to a queue and deals
with them in a different process.

I will tell you about some of the things you should look for when choosing your
messaging system, and what are the things to look for when you start developing
your messaging system.
