I am a young lecturer and passionate about teaching. At my university we have a
department dedicated to web development. So I am lucky enough to teach
something fancy and new every year but we still need to cover basics of
computer science in our courses.

As web developers, we are not recognized for our scientific research but we are
still the people pushing the web forward every day/week/month of the year. How
do we fit into this classic science ecosystem and do we need the system at all?

Initiatives such as OTS, Rails Girls, nodeschool, Codeweek are quite good in
getting people into programming and they are also more inclusive than classic
institutions such as universities. So why does someone still think about
attending a university? Does anyone really need to go there to learn tooling
and programming?

In this talk I will take you on a journey on how my department evolved (now 6
years old) and what we did to address at least a dozen of issues we had with
our department within this system.

Our goal is to teach people everything they need to become a Full-stack developer someday.

This covers the content of courses, increasing the diversity in classes,
getting science and economy together, finding lecturers, translate theoretical
computer science topics into something useful for web developers and so onâ€¦

You might have to laugh a lot during this talk but be prepared for the sad parts.
