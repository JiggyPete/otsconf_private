**old**:
The Web is the universal platform, and Firefox OS is a mobile operating system
built on open web technologies. The entire user interface, from lock screen to
notification drawer to dialer is built entirely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
which means you can live-debug and edit *anything* on your Phone with just the
Firefox DevTools.

...and since everything on the phone can be controlled by JavaScript, Firefox
OS phones make excellent IoT devices. Come learn how to use your existing JS
skills to hack your phone into something it never dreamed of being!

**new**:
There will be a quick intro to Rust, but more an appetizer than anything else: there will be *loads* of hands-on demos, though.
We will show how even without the slightest electrical engineering and low-level systems-programming knowledge one can prototype real,
tangible hardware products via tools provided by hardware like the Tessel (2), Firefox OS phones and maybe even the MozOpenHard open-source FirefoxOS developer board.
This might be the very first appearance of Tessel 2 before its official launch and shipping of preorders in early September,
and if we can get our dirty paws on some preliminary MozOpenHard open-source FxOS developer boards we will be showcasing that one too
(two presenters? two exclusives? hardware hacking? IoT? JS on microcontrollers? WHAT IS THIS MADNESS? the wacky hardware-hacking in this session is just TOO DAMN HIGH!).

Also, the best thing is all code we will write will be easy to understand, human-friendly JavaScript or Rust - so this really *is* for the masses, anyone can do this! ;)
