There will be a quick intro to Rust, but more an appetizer than anything else: there will be *loads* of hands-on demos, though.
We will show how even without the slightest electrical engineering and low-level systems-programming knowledge one can prototype real,
tangible hardware products via tools provided by hardware like the Tessel (2), Firefox OS phones and maybe even the MozOpenHard open-source FirefoxOS developer board.
This might be the very first appearance of Tessel 2 before its official launch and shipping of preorders in early September,
and if we can get our dirty paws on some preliminary MozOpenHard open-source FxOS developer boards we will be showcasing that one too
(two presenters? two exclusives? hardware hacking? IoT? JS on microcontrollers? The absurd hardware-hacking in this session is just TOO DAMN HIGH!).

Also, the best thing is all code we will write will be easy to understand, human-friendly JavaScript or Rust - so this really *is* for the masses, anyone can do this! ;)
