Developers have a huge responsibility to users. Not everyone is able to hear
and see your website. People have handicaps. The web is just too important to
not care about those people. Imagine a world in your life where you are not
able to use the web. It would not be that easy for you to learn something new,
to discover great things, to connect with other people. As a developer it is
important to remember how much people depend on your way of implementation and
how much you can change other people's life.
