For several years now there have been a lot of fancy new products allowing you
to automate more and more aspects of your home. This ranges from simple
radio-controlled sockets to smartphone-controlled lightbulbs and
internet-connected weather-stations.

The problem is: All of these products are ridiculously expensive, use
proprietary and mostly closed-source technology, are not compatible to one
another and are generally not very hacker-friendly.

I want to show you a different approach: All of the above - and a lot more -
can be done using just some cheap off-the-shelf components and open technology.
You don't even need a degree in electrical engineering for this. And as a bonus
you'll be able to control all of your future-home components using nothing but
your browser.

When the conference is over you'll want to place your orders and start using
what you learned to build your very own internet of things.
