Today's development environment is heavily focussed on "mobile first", but the
long-term transition to this framework has been a challenging one. From mobile
technology's first forays into web connectivity, user-friendliness and market
shaping, Japanese mobile culture has without a doubt had a lasting influence on
how we make our development and design decisions.

This talk traces the advent of the mobile first paradigm from its roots in the
Japanese mobile revolution, through to the power within the country's changing
topography of market end-users, and some of the current issues that face mobile
development and design in both Japan and the West. How did Japan's early mobile
connectivity set the pace and priorities for not only burgeoning technology,
but also the incipient business models that would grow to dominate our tech
culture? Has the advent of smartphones really evened the playing field?

Through the lens of cultural psychology, technological history, and market
analytics we'll take a closer look at how and why our mobile web is
inextricably linked to Japan.
