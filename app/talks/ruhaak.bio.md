Anouk started her professional career as an economist, but quickly turned to coding.
First as an iOS developer, now as a web developer (with Python and Javascript).
She likes to learn for the sake of learning and to help others do the same.
When she's not busy coding she helps run Hackership, a learning retreat for developers.
