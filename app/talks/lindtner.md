### A true story about Open Source, change and Rails Girls Summer of Code.

This talk is a bit of a magic trick. It will solve a problem that seems pretty unsolvable right now: Getting more women into tech. We’ve all heard of more and more women leaving the tech industry. What’s happening? How did we get here? What can we do?

I’ll tell you a true story about 33 women from all over the world: directors, photographers, PR manager, linguists and many more that wrote Open Source code for 3 months.  It’s a story about role models, community - and cat gifs. With the women focussed scholarship program Rails Girls Summer of Code we are writing history in Open Source and I will tell you how it’s done. How to raise $80k, how to build a community based project, that will keep on going and how to change 33 lives.

With this talk we will go on a short adventure in the tech jungle and see what we can achieve as a community and where we are failing. How we can get more women in Open Source, instead of losing them.

And why the f*ck we should care.
