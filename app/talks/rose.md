Not happy with the face of your local tech scene? The fastest way to shape your
local community is to teach or support enthusiastic newbies. While we’ll look
at some of the great mentorship and teaching programs that are available now,
you don’t have to limit yourself to existing programs to start helping out.
We’ll look at field tested routes to support new programmers that fit a range
of different commitment levels. With enough of us helping out, we can change
the face of our industry, as well as our local tech communities.
