Native apps allow you to take full advantage of all the device features. The downside? You have to develop, well, native apps. That’s a steep learning curve if  you are a web developer. But did you know how easy it is to access motion sensors in mobile browsers? Or that that you can access geolocation data? You can read gyroscope and accelerometer data in your web app and it is stunningly simple. In fact, so simple, that I can show you how to capture motion sensor data with just a few lines of code. We’ll also take a peek at ServiceWorker, a new feature for the web platform that lets a script persistently cache resources and handle all resource requests for an application.With ServiceWorker you can build web apps that work offline. You can use it as a basis for “background” features such as push messaging and background sync. Allowing you to build web apps with even more native features.
