Security is often the neglected step-child of web-development. It has the reputation of being hard and complex and in general to be someone else's problem. Too often it's addressed after the project launched - or shortly before it's supposed to go live (after all, you are supposed to write bug-free software, right?).

In my talk I want to show you why it matters to bake security into your project right from the start, how to act responsibly concerning your users' data and how to develop a good understanding of fundamental security topics.
